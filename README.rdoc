= dm-gen


dm-gen is a collection of generators for DataMapper, to allieviate the need to
type boilerplate code to get started on a project. dm-gen uses
templater[http://github.com/jnicklas/templater] as a base.

== The Generators

=== one_file


The one file generator generates a single file, which sets up a connection to an
in memory sqlite3 database, along with debug logging and a example model, which
it then automigrates.  One file scripts are great to use as demonstration,
either of a bug, or just how to do something.

=== is


The is generator generates an 'is' plugin structure, appropriate for plugins
such as dm-is-list, dm-is-remixable etc.  A complete plugin structure is
generated, including a Rakefile and spec suite skeleton.

=== adapter


The adapter generator generates an adapter structure, appropriate for adapters
to new data-sources, such as couchdb, YAML files, or anything else.  A complete
plugin structure is generated.  The adapter file generated comes with a lot of
documentation explaining the arguments and returns of the 4 methods in the DM
adaptor API.

NB: This generates adapters with the 1.0 API, so make sure you're running that
